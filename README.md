An app for delivering food to students by students using only university food debit as the currency

This app is currently a work in progress.

The idea of the app is to let students order food or beverages available from their on campus stores using their food debit. Once a student orders food, other students who are nearby that store can choose to deliver that to the orderer. The orderer gets charged a delivery fee which is also food debit and this fee goes directly to the delvery person's food debit account.

So if Student A ordered something and doesn't have the time to go all the to the store to pick up, and Student B happens to be going towards Student A's direction from the store, Student B can deliver it and get paid for it. By using this service students aren't paying any extra money other than what they had already paid for getting the food debit and another student gets to enjoy a meal/beverage after couple deliveries!

# Technology Used
Swift for the app and Python's Django REST Framework for the server side.
